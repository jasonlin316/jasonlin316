I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [FPGA/Parallel Computing Lab](https://fpga.usc.edu) at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
I will be joining the [AI System Co-Design team](https://aisystemcodesign.github.io) at Meta as a Research Scientist this Summer.
My recent work focuses on developing Automated ML Systems, such as an auto-tuning runtime system for GNN training, and automatic model parallelization for LLM serving. 
I was a Research Intern at the Microsoft AI Framework team, where I worked on optimizing distributed inference for LLM serving.
Please refer to my personal [website](https://jasonlin316.github.io/publications/) for more details.
I completed my undergraduate study in National Taiwan University (NTU), majored in Electrical Engineering. I was also an Electrical Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Taipei.

In addition to research interests, I'm also interested in video editing and photography. Check out my [vlogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOgPUn4uH3eyITpOyIsteJNxuKTRnYb6v) and [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194564724@N08/albums).
