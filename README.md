I am joining the [AI System Co-Design team](https://aisystemcodesign.github.io) at Meta as a Research Scientist.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna]((https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/)). My dissertation focused on Automated Graph ML Systems, such as an auto-tuning runtime system for GNN training. I was also a Research Intern at Microsoft AI Framework team, where I worked on automatic model parallelization for LLM serving. 
I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU).

In addition to research interests, I'm also into video editing and photography. Check out my [vlogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOgPUn4uH3eyITpOyIsteJNxuKTRnYb6v) and [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194564724@N08/albums).
